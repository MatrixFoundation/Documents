| Toolchain/version manager | Rust compiler | Code formatter | Linter   | Package manager | Package registry |
|---------------------------|---------------|----------------|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| `rustup`                  | `rustc`       | `rustfmt`      | `clippy` | `cargo`         | `crates.io`      |

## I. Introduction 💡

- `rustup`: the Rust toolchain installer and updater. This tool is used to install and update `rustc` and `cargo` when new versions of Rust are released. In addition, `rustup` can also download documentation for the standard library. You can have multiple versions of Rust installed at once and `rustup` will let you switch between them as needed.

- `rustc`: the Rust compiler which turns `.rs` files into binaries and other intermediate formats.

- `rustfmt`: a tool for formatting Rust code according to style guidelines. It ensures that Rust code is consistent and adheres to community standards.

- `clippy`: a collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code. It provides suggestions for idiomatic Rust usage and helps maintain code quality.

- `cargo`: the Rust dependency manager and build tool. Cargo knows how to download dependencies, usually hosted on [https://crates.io](https://crates.io/), and it will pass them to `rustc` when building your project. Cargo also comes with a built-in test runner which is used to execute unit tests.

- `crates.io`: the official package registry for Rust, where developers can publish, discover, and manage Rust libraries (crates). It serves as the primary source for Rust packages and dependencies.

## II. `Editions` 📚

Editions in Rust are a structured way to introduce new features and improvements while maintaining backward compatibility. This ensures that code written in older editions will still compile with newer compilers.

Rust editions are released every three years, allowing significant changes to be introduced without breaking existing code.

So far, Rust has had three editions: 2015, 2018, and 2021. Each edition introduces new syntax, features, and improvements.

The edition is specified in the Cargo.toml file under the `[package]` section, guiding the Rust compiler on which edition's rules to apply.

Code from different editions can coexist within the same project, allowing for gradual migration to newer editions.

Tools like `cargo fix` assist in migrating code to a newer edition by automatically applying necessary changes.

Editions enable Rust to evolve and improve without disrupting existing projects, making it easier for developers to adopt new features at their own pace.

## III. `Crate` 📦

Rust implements code modularity and organization through its `crate` system.

`crates`, the fundamental compilation units in Rust, can be compiled into executable binaries or libraries. This structure promotes code modularity, reusability and separation of concerns.

The `crate` system also facilitates code sharing, enabling developers to reuse functional modules across different projects, thereby enhancing development efficiency and reducing duplication of effort. Through `crate`, Rust provides robust support for structuring large projects and collaborative development.

### Binary Crate 💻

Usually `main.rs` is used as the entry point, which is compiled to produce an executable.

```rust
// src/main.rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Library Crate 📦

Usually `lib.rs` is the main file, which is compiled to generate libraries for use by other programs.

```rust
// src/lib.rs
pub fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}
```

This crate can be referenced by other `crate`.

```rust
// src/main.rs
use my_library::greet;

fn main() {
    let message = greet("Alice");
    println!("{}", message);
}
```

## IV. `Modules` 📚

Modules in Rust are similar to namespaces in C++ and packages in Java.

In Rust, a single `crate` can contain multiple modules.

When we talk about functional modules, we're referring to grouping functions or structures based on their functionality. It's common to organize similar functions, or functions and structures that implement the same functionality or work together to implement a functionality, into a single module.

### 1. Define modules 📦

```rust
mod module_name {
   fn function_name() {
      // ……
   }
}
```

In Rust, modules are private by default. If a module or a function within a module needs to be exported for external use, the `pub` keyword must be added. Private modules cannot be called by other external modules or programs. All functions in a private module must be private, while a public module can have both public and private functions.

```rust
pub mod public_module {
   pub fn public_function() {
      // ……
   }
   fn private_function() {
      // ……
   }
}
mod private_module {
   fn private_function() {
	   // ……
   }
}
```

### 2. Call module 📞

```rust
use pub_module::function_name;
```

Create library：

`cargo new –lib mylib`

```rust
// src/lib.rs

/// Adds two numbers and returns the result.
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

/// Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.
pub fn multiply(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a * b
}
```

Go to the mylib directory and execute `cargo build`.

Open the root directory Cargo.toml

```toml
[dependencies]
mylib = { path = "..//mylib" }
```

```rust
// src/main.rs
use mylib::{add, multiply};

fn main() {
    let sum = add(5, 10);
    let product = multiply(5, 10);

    println!("Sum: {}", sum);
    println!("Product: {}", product);
}
```

Rust allows nesting of one module within another, or, in other words, multiple levels of modules. To call or use a nested module use two colons (`::`) to splice modules from left to right, from outside to inside.

```rust
use mod1::mod2::mod3::method_name;

fn main() {
    method_name();
}
```

### 3. Path 🛤

Absolute path: start at crate root, use crate name or the literal value crate;

Relative path: start from the current module, use self, super or the identifier of the current module;

If the defined part and the used part always move together, use a relative path; if they can be detached independently, use an absolute path.

```
my_crate
├── src
│   ├── lib.rs
│   └── utils.rs
```

```rust
// src/utils.rs
pub fn greet() {
    println!("Hello!");
}
```

```rust
// src/lib.rs
pub mod utils;

fn main() {
    my_crate::utils::greet();
    crate::utils::greet();
}
```

```
my_crate
├── src
│   ├── lib.rs
│   └── module_a.rs
│   └── module_b.rs
```

```rust
// src/module_a.rs
pub fn function_a() {
    println!("Function A");
    self::function_b();
}

pub fn function_b() {
    println!("Function B");
}
```

```rust
// src/module_b.rs
pub fn call_function_a() {
    super::module_a::function_a();
}
```

```rust
// src/lib.rs
pub mod module_a;
pub mod module_b;

fn main() {
    module_b::call_function_a();
}
```

## V. `Cargo` 🚢

`Cargo`, Rust’s package manager and build system, simplifies many tasks associated with managing dependencies, compiling packages, and distributing software. This ecosystem makes it easy for developers to share libraries, streamline their build processes, and manage multiple projects with ease. 

```
Moreover, Rust’s compiler is renowned for its helpful error messages that not only tell you what went wrong but also suggest how to fix it.
```

`Cargo` simplifies the Rust development workflow by managing project creation, building, and dependency management.

### 1. Command ⌨️

```
The `cargo new` command initializes a new Rust project with a default directory structure.

Adding dependencies is straightforward; you modify the `Cargo.toml` file, and `Cargo` handles fetching and compiling the necessary `crates`.

The `cargo build` command compiles the project, and `cargo run` compiles and runs the project. This seamless integration makes Rust development more efficient and organized.

`Cargo` also supports running tests with `cargo test`, generating documentation with `cargo doc`, and publishing libraries to `crates.io` with `cargo publish`. Its comprehensive feature set and ease of use make it a crucial tool in the Rust ecosystem.

The `cargo --list` command lists all available `cargo` subcommands along with brief descriptions, helping developers quickly understand the features and options provided by `cargo` for more efficient management of Rust projects.

Use `cargo check` to quickly check your project for errors, use `cargo build` to compile it without running it. You will find the output in `target/debug/` for a normal debug build. Use `cargo build --release` to produce an optimized release build in `target/release/`.

`--verbose` is a common command-line parameter used to make a program output more runtime information, allowing for a better understanding of the program's operational state and more detailed debugging. The specific meaning and behavior may vary depending on the particular program.
```

| Command         | Description                                                                                                                           |

| `cargo check`   | Analyzes the current project and reports errors without compiling any files.                                                          |
| `cargo build`   | Compiles the current project, generating an executable or library in the `target` directory.                                          |
| `cargo run`     | Compiles and runs the file `src/main.rs`.                                                                                             |
| `cargo clean`   | Removes the `target` directory and all its subdirectories and files from the current project.                                         |
| `cargo update`  | Updates all dependencies listed in the `Cargo.lock` file of the current project.                                                      |
| `cargo test`    | Runs all tests in the project to ensure code correctness and stability.                                                               |

| `--verbose`     | Makes the program output more runtime information, aiding in debugging and understanding the program's operational state.             |

### 2. `Cargo.toml` 📜

`Cargo.toml` is a configuration file for managing your project’s metadata and dependencies.

The `TOML` file format is, like JavaScript Object Notation (`JSON`) or YAML Ain’t Markup Language (`YAML`).

By specifying different version constraints in this file, developers can control the versions of the libraries their project depends on. This is crucial for ensuring the stability and compatibility of the project.

| Cargo.toml Line           | Meaning                                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `image = "=0.10.0"`       | Use only the exact version 0.10.0                         |
| `image = ">=1.0.5"`       | Use version 1.0.5 or higher (including 2.9, if available) |
| `image = ">1.0.5 <1.1.9"` | Use a version greater than 1.0.5 but less than 1.1.9      |
| `image = "<=2.7.10"`      | Use version 2.7.10 or any earlier version                 |

### 3. `Cargo.lock` 🔒

When building a project for the first time, Cargo outputs a `Cargo.lock` file to record the exact version of each crate it uses. Subsequent builds will refer to this file and continue using the same versions. Cargo will only upgrade to newer versions when you explicitly request it, either by manually increasing the version number in the `Cargo.toml` file or by running `cargo update`.

The `Cargo.lock` file is automatically generated and typically doesn't need manual editing. However, if your project is an executable, you should commit the `Cargo.lock` file to version control. This ensures that everyone building the project always gets the same versions. The version history of the `Cargo.lock` file will record these dependency updates.

## VI. Optimization 优化 🚀

In Rust, optimization can significantly improve a program's performance. Below are some common optimization techniques, including compilation configuration, link-time optimization, panic handling, and compile-time optimization.

### 1. Compilation Configuration ⚙

Debug Mode (`cargo build`):

- Configuration Section: `[profile.dev]`
- Advantages: Fast compilation, suitable for debugging
- Disadvantages: Slower runtime, no optimization

Release Mode (`cargo build --release`):

- Configuration Section: `[profile.release]`
- Advantages: Faster runtime, various optimizations
- Disadvantages: Longer compilation time, larger binary size

It is common practice to use debug mode during development and release mode when deploying.

By default, Rust builds in debug mode. If you run `cargo build`, `cargo run`, or `rustc` without any additional options, it will generate a debug build. Debug builds are useful for debugging but are not optimized.

When you compile your Rust program in release mode, the compiler performs a series of optimizations such as inlining, loop unrolling, dead code elimination, and constant folding. These optimizations make your program run faster, but they also increase compilation time and may result in larger binary files.

```rust
// src/main.rs
fn fibonacci(n: u64) -> u64 {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n;
    }
    fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
}

fn main() {
    let n = 40;
    println!("Fibonacci({}) = {}", n, fibonacci(n));
}
```

```shell
# Debug模式
$ cargo run
   Compiling fib v0.1.0 (/path/to/fib)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.50s
     Running `target/debug/fib`
Fibonacci(40) = 102334155
# 运行时间：约5秒

# Release模式
$ cargo run --release
   Compiling fib v0.1.0 (/path/to/fib)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.72s
     Running `target/release/fib`
Fibonacci(40) = 102334155
# 运行时间：约0.05秒
```

- `[unoptimized + debuginfo]` indicates that a debug build was generated. The compiled code will be placed in the `target/debug/` directory. `cargo run` will run the program built in debug mode.

- `[optimized]` indicates that a release build was generated. The compiled code will be placed in the `target/release/` directory. `cargo run --release` will run the program built in release mode.

### 2. Link-Time Optimization 🔨

Link-Time Optimization (LTO) is a whole-program optimization technique that can improve runtime performance by 10%-20% or more at the cost of increased build time. For a single Rust program, it's usually worthwhile to trade off compilation time for runtime performance. Enabling LTO slightly increases compilation time but further reduces runtime.

The simplest way to enable LTO is to add the following lines to `Cargo.toml` and then perform a release build.

```toml
[profile.release]
lto = true
```

Alternatively, using `lto = "thin"` in `Cargo.toml` enables Thin LTO, a less aggressive form of LTO that is usually as effective as full LTO but doesn’t significantly increase build time.

```toml
[profile.release]
lto = "thin"
```

```
cargo run --release
```

### 3. Panic! with Abort 🔗

If you don't need to catch or unwind from a panic, you can configure the program to abort on panic. This can reduce the binary size and slightly improve performance:

```toml
[profile.release]
panic = "abort"
```

```
# 优化前
$ ls -lh target/release/fib
-rwxr-xr-x 2 user user 3.8M Aug 13 10:00 target/release/fib

# 优化后
$ cargo build --release
$ ls -lh target/release/fib
-rwxr-xr-x 2 user user 3.6M Aug 13 10:05 target/release/fib
```

### 4. Faster Linker 🚀

It is recommended to use [lld](https://lld.llvm.org/), which supports ELF, PE/COFF, Mach-O, wasm, and more.

To specify using `lld` via the command line, you can prepend your build command with `RUSTFLAGS="-C link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"`.

Alternatively, you can configure it in `config.toml`:

```toml
[build]
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"]
```

```
# 使用默认链接器
$ time cargo build --release
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 25.32s

real    0m25.320s
user    0m24.156s
sys     0m1.164s

# 使用lld
$ RUSTFLAGS="-C link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld" time cargo build --release
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 20.15s

real    0m20.150s
user    0m19.228s
sys     0m0.922s
```

### 5. Incremental Compilation ➕

The Rust compiler supports incremental compilation, which avoids redundant work during recompilation. It can significantly speed up compilation, but sometimes it may result in slower-running executables. Therefore, it is enabled by default only for debug builds. If you want to enable it for release builds as well, add the following to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[profile.release]
incremental = true
```

```
$ touch src/main.rs
$ time cargo build --release
   Compiling project v0.1.0 (/path/to/project)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 1m 45s

real    1m45.150s
user    1m43.228s
sys     0m1.922s


$ touch src/main.rs
$ time cargo build --release
   Compiling project v0.1.0 (/path/to/project)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0m 25s

real    0m25.120s
user    0m24.156s
sys     0m0.964s
```
