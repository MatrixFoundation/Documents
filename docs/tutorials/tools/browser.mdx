## I. User Experience 📝

Browsers play a crucial role in modern life, serving as our window to the world of the internet 🌐, enabling us to conveniently access vast amounts of information and resources 📚.

There are two main "camps" of browsers on the market. The Chrome core has certain advantages in terms of performance and function expansion ⚡️, while the Firefox core pays more attention to user privacy and security protection 🔒. Users can choose the browser that suits them according to their personal needs 🖥️.
