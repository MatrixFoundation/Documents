## I. Language Overview üíª

`C#` (pronounced "C sharp") is a modern, type-safe, object-oriented programming language designed and developed by Microsoft. While maintaining the expressiveness and efficiency of `C++`, it also provides modern features such as automatic memory management and exception handling.

:::info
The `#` symbol in musical notation represents sharp, indicating that a note should be raised by a half step when marked with `#`. This naming reflects Microsoft's ambition and positioning for the language ‚Äî to both inherit the excellent traditions of the C language family while achieving enhancement and breakthrough.

As a versatile and powerful language, `C#` is widely used in various fields. It is particularly very popular in gameplay programming. With its powerful performance and flexibility, it has become the preferred language for game developers.

:::tip
This tutorial will focus on practical syntax and skills based on actual game development needs.
:::

`C#` is most prominently known as the language used for scripting in the Unity game engine. The Godot engine also supports writing game logic in `C#`.

Unity implements cross-platform `C#` scripting support through Mono.

Godot 3.x uses Mono as its `C#` runtime environment. Godot 4.x adopts native .NET support, gradually migrating to the modern .NET ecosystem.

:::info
Mono is an open-source implementation of the .NET framework that provides cross-platform development solutions, offering developers a complete .NET-compatible environment.

## II. Language Characteristics üë•

- Object-Oriented: `C#` supports the principles of object-oriented programming, making it easier to organize and structure code.

- Type-Safe: `C#` is a statically-typed language, meaning variables must be declared with a specific data type, enhancing code safety.

- Memory Management: `C#` includes automatic memory management through garbage collection, reducing the risk of memory leaks.

- Modern language features: `C#` continues to evolve and introduces many modern programming language features, making development more efficient and flexible.

- Open source ecosystem: `C#` has an active open source community that provides a large number of open source projects, documents and resources to help solve problems encountered in cross-platform development.

## III. Development environment üñ•Ô∏è

### .NET SDK üîß

.NET SDK: This software development kit includes compilers, libraries, and other resources for developing applications in `C#`.

üëâ [.NET SDK Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

### .NET Framework üîß

.NET Framework is a traditional framework that has been available for many years, specifically for the Windows platform.

### .NET Core üîß

.NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source version of .NET, designed to support modern applications.

### .NET üîß

The .NET platform merge the capabilities of both .NET Framework and .NET Core and offering developers a singular platform to create applications of any kind. These developments were necessitated to adapt to modern technological trends and demands for improved performance and scalability.

### Development tools üìä

The main IDE for `C#` is Visual Studio from Microsoft.

However, there are alternatives, such as Visual Studio Code (a lightweight code editor with support for `C#` extensions) and JetBrains Rider.

Each environment has its own benefits and features, and the choice depends on the specific needs of the developer:

- Visual Studio: Comprehensive IDE with advanced tools for large-scale projects and multi-language support.

- JetBrains Rider: Cross-platform .NET IDE with powerful tools for .NET development and a rich set of plugins.

## IV. Hello World üëã

Open your development tool and create a console project, or use the command line `dotnet new console` to create a new console application. Use `dotnet run` to compile and run a simple `C#` program.

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

The entry point in a `C#` program is typically represented by the `Main()` method, which is located in the `Program` class. This method must be static and serves as the starting point for the program's execution.

`void` is the keyword and means this section of our program ‚Äì called a method ‚Äì will not "return" any values.

Both `Console.WriteLine()` and `Console.Write()` print information to the console.

Common `C#` program structure:

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // program code
    }
}
```

The `args` argument contains an array of strings that is passed to the program upon its launch.
